# React Redux Firebase Firestore Boilerplate

 - This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 - This hooks up [react-redux-firebase](react-redux-firebase) and [redux-firestore](https://github.com/prescottprue/redux-firestore) to Redux store out-of-the-box.
 - When working in local you need to install the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).
 - Supply your `.env` with config from Firebase.

## Other packages included:
- date-fns
- formik
- lodash
- redux-thunk
